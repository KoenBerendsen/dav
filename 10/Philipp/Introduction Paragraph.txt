For this assignment we have used a dataset of UK Traffic Accidents found on kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/data?select=accidents_2012_to_2014.csv). Given the size of the dataset  (over 600 MB)  we decided to focus only on the timeframe 2012 to 2014. This still gives us over 450.000 data entries to work with. The data is very well structured and requires no dropping of data due to incomplete records. 
The data set contains information coming from police reports on major car accidents throughout the UK. In all there are 33 columns containing location information (coordinates, police force and administrative area), date information (date, time, day of the week, year), information on the road where the accident took place (weather, type of road, overpasses, junctions) and the severity of the accident (severity, casualties).   Further descriptions for the columns can be found in the file 7752_road-accident-safety-data-guide.xls.
Given this breadth of ordinal, categorical and numerical information, there are many different questions that can be looked into.  For example, one could attempt to predict the accident severity based on the type of street and weather conditions. Given the large amount of data it should also be possible to split the data set into many individual sets and tune the parameters of the given predictions.
